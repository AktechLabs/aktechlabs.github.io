    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 24, 2025</p>

    <p>Aktech Labs ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Tmini mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.</p>

    <h2>1.0 Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Information stored locally on your device</h3>
    <p>Tmini is designed with privacy in mind. The app stores the following information locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SSH connection details (hostnames, usernames, port numbers)</li>
        <li>SSH private keys (securely stored in iOS Keychain)</li>
        <li>Connection history and preferences</li>
        <li>App settings and configurations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Information we do NOT collect</h3>
    <p>We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal information on our servers, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SSH credentials or private keys</li>
        <li>Connection details or server information</li>
        <li>Terminal session data or commands</li>
        <li>Any personal or sensitive information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2.0 Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Local Storage</h3>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted to external servers. Your SSH private keys are securely stored in the iOS Keychain, which provides hardware-level encryption and biometric protection.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Biometric Authentication</h3>
    <p>When you enable Face ID or Touch ID protection, your biometric data is processed entirely by iOS and never accessed by our app. We only receive confirmation of successful or failed authentication.</p>

    <h2>3.0 Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Tmini does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The app operates entirely offline regarding data collection.</p>

    <h2>4.0 Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Deleting the app removes all stored data</li>
        <li>You can manually delete individual connections and SSH keys through the app interface</li>
        <li>No data persists on external servers after app deletion</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5.0 Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Tmini is rated 4+ and is suitable for all ages. Since we do not collect any personal information, there are no special privacy considerations for children using the app. All data remains locally stored on the device.</p>

    <h2>6.0 Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>

    <h2>7.0 Contact Us</h2>
